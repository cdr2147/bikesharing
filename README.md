## Overview
After visiting New York City and using the Citi Bike bike share program to get around town, you are now thinking of starting a similar bike share business in your hometown of Des Moines, Iowa. You have a potential investor who will provide seed funding; however, you must see how the bike share program works in NYC. After analyzing data from NYC, you will create a proposal of how this business could work in Des Moines, Iowa.  

### Purpose
We create data visualizations in Tableau to provide analysis of Citi Bike data in New York City and inform a business proposal for creating such a business in Des Moines. 

## Results
We create a dashboard and Tableau story in Tableau using the Citi Bike data from August 2019. August is a popular time for bike riding due to the weather and is determined to be a good month to analyze for this project.

### Visualizations
We create a Tableau story with 7 visualizations of the NYC Citi Bike data

### Analzying the data:

#### Checkout Times for Users
![Checkout TImes for Users](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99205688/170886962-2df9056a-b0fe-4f07-a074-5318548ede7d.PNG)
By graphing checkout times by users, we can see that the largest number of riders in August 2019 took rides that were 22 minutes or less, with 5 minutes being the most popular trip duration. 

#### Checkout Times by Gender

In this chart, we can see that many more male riders use the service than female riders. The peak trip duration for males was 5 minutes with 108,087 male riders using the service for that length of time. The peak trip duration for females was 6 minutes with 34,151 female riders using the service for that length of time.

#### Trips by Weekday per Hour

By analzying the number of trips by weekday per hour in a heatmap, we can see that weekdays see the heaviest usage of bikes in the mornings between 8 and 9am, and in the evenings between 5 and 8pm. This is most likely due to users commuting to and from work. Weekend usage is heavier during the daytime than during weekdays, and this could be due to tourists visiting on weekends and New Yorkers using the service when there is no obligation to be in the office during the workday.

#### Trips by Gender(Weekday per Hour)

By analyzing the number of trips by weekday per hour broken down by gender, we can see that male usage is heavier during the commuting hours during the week than female usage. We can see that male users most often use the service for their commute.

#### User Trips by Gender by Weekday

By breaking down user trips by gender by weekday, we can see that there is little difference between non-subscription female and male usage by weekday; however, male subscribers are more likely to the use the service than their non-subscribing counterparts and their heaviest usage is on weekdays. Subscribing females use the service more than non-subscription females, but bike usage is a bit more evenly distributed throughout the day as compared to male subscribers. 

#### August Peak Hours

By graphing the overall peak hours of bike usage in August, regardless of the day of the week, we can see that usage between 5pm and 7pm is the most popular time for users and most bikes need to be available for at those times.

#### Top Starting Locations

By plotting the most popular starting locations on the map, we can see that most popular starting locations are in lower Manhattan. This may due to commuters who live and work in Manhattan and only travel a short distance to the office. It may also be that tourists or other New Yorkers start at a convenient location in Manhattan to see the sites.

## Summary
Overall, it can be seen that the bike share program in NYC has the greatest usage during commuting hours on weekdays, and during the daytime on weekends, with Saturday being more popular than Sunday. Trip duration peaked at 5 minutes and most riders do not ride for more than 22 minutes. Male riders greatly outnumber female riders, are more likely to be subscribers than female riders, and most often use the service to commute during weekdays. 

When planning whether this business will prosper in Des Moines, Iowa, it will be important to analyze gender data in the city and how commuters get to work. In New York City, commute distances can be short and many of those who live in Manhattan do not have a car, which may not be the same in Des Moines. It would also be worth exploring how many tourists are in Des Moines and if there are any other demographics who may make use of a bike share program. 

Two additional visualizations of the Citi Bike data that could be useful are:
* User Trips by Age by Weekday to see how different age demographics use the bike share program during the week
* User Trips by Age and Gender to see if there is any impact of age on the different usage of bikes between male and females
